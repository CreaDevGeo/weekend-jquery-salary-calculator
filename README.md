## Description

- Base Mode -
✅  - Create an input form that collects employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.
✅  - Make a 'Submit' button that collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields. 
✅  - Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.
✅  - Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. 
✅      - For Base mode, it does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

- Stretch Mode -
✅  - Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.
    - Once the employee is deleted, update the Total Monthly Cost section on the page to reflect the employee's removal. HINT: You will need to figure out which employee was removed, in order to subtract their salary from the total. Consider using .text() as a getter, or look into jQuery's .data() function. This is tricky!
