/* **** WEEKEND CHALLENGE ðŸ‘Š: jQuery Salary Calculator ****

ðŸŽ¯ Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs.

Topics Covered
- JavaScript
- jQuery - Selectors, append, and event handling

| Assignment |

âœ¨ The application should have an input form that collects employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.
âœ¨ A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color to the total monthly cost.
âœ¨ Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Base mode, it does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

- ðŸ˜“ Stretch Mode -
âœ¨Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.
âœ¨Once the employee is deleted, update the Total Monthly Cost section on the page to reflect the employee's removal. HINT: You will need to figure out which employee was removed, in order to subtract their salary from the total. Consider using .text() as a getter, or look into jQuery's .data() function. This is tricky!

- Reminder About Modes -
Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

what to expect when attempting each mode
if they are required or not
Mode	Description
Base	required
Stretch	optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research
